# Exercise 4 Answers

## Exploration Questions

 When I say "I want to build a robot." it replies "What would it mean to build a robot?"

 When I say "I want to understand French." it replies "What would it mean to understand French?"

 When I say "Do you like me?" it replies "What makes you think that I like you?"

 When I say "You confuse me." it replies "What makes you think that I confuse you?"

## Example Questions

 If you put a subject in the sentence, it can't translate that subject. If, for example, I say "I want to murder you with a spatula" it replies "What would it mean to murder you with a spatula?", not translating the 'you in the question to 'me' in the response.

 It can't correctly parse "You and me were meant to be together" because it responds "What makes you think you and me?" It gets the word between 'me' and 'you' and thinks of it as a verb. It needs to recognize questions and be able to isolate verbs. It can't handle 'you and me' as a subject.
